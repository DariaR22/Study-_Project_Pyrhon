## Analysis of student performance
**Code:** [Student Performance Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/DariaR22/Study_Projects_Python/blob/main/Student%20Performance%20Analysis%20.ipynb)  
**Description:** There is data of student performance: subjects, tests, dates and scores. We are required to analyze completed lessons and answer several questions about complition of courses.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, data analysis, cohort analysis, RFM analysis, defining metrics.  
**Technology:** Python (Pandas)  
**Results:** recieved information about students who have successfully completed the course, found the most difficult and simplest exam, the average period of passing exams in each subject, the most popular courses by the number of registrations and courses with the largest outflow, semester with the lowest completion of courses and the longest average terms of completion of courses.   

## Analysis of the drivers outflow
**Code:** [Python_Project_2.ipynb](https://github.com/DariaR22/Study_Projects_Python/blob/main/Python_Project_2.ipynb)  
**Description:** There is data from taxi company (uber) that wants to study the outflow of drivers and see what differences there are between drivers who leave the service and who stay. It is necessary to formulate and test hypotheses, identify groups of drivers who are most susceptible to "churn" and conduct statistical tests. Based on the results, it is required to draw conclusions about what can be improved in the service in order to make changes in the future.    
**Skills:** data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, data visualization, descriptive statistics, Shapiro–Wilk test, data transforms, Mann–Whitney U test, chi-square, defining metrics.  
**Technology:** Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)  
**Results:** tested hypothesis, detected statistically significant results and offered recommendations

## Analysis of AB test results on the website
**Code:** [Analysis of AB test results on the website.ipynb](https://github.com/DariaR22/Study_Projects_Python/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20AB%20test%20results%20on%20the%20website.ipynb)  
**Description:** We have the result of A/B testing. During the testing of one hypothesis, the target group was offered a new mechanics of paying for services on the site, the control group remained with the basic mechanics. It is necessary to analyze the results of the experiment and conclude whether it is worth launching a new payment mechanism for all users or not.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, data analysis, data visualization, descriptive statistics,  data transforms, defining metrics, normality test, Levene test, Bootstrap method.  
**Technology:** Python (Pandas, Numpy, Pingouin, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, tqdm)  
**Results:** analyzed A/B test results, tested hypothesis, detected statistically significant results, made conclusion on launching a new payment mechanism
